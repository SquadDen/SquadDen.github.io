Hey my name is Denim Waters. I am 22 years old and I was born in NYC. Although I was born there most of my earliest memories are in Raleigh, North Carolina. I've lived in Raleigh since I was 5. Some of my hobbies include watching anime, playing video games, and roller skating. This is my second semester at Wake Tech and I am looking to do software development as a career.
